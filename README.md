Code Lab: AngularDart
=================

AngularDart is the Dart version of Angular,
a client-side structural framework for creating dynamic web applications.
With Angular, you can concentrate on your applicationâ€™s logic, and not on DOM manipulation.
Use HTML as the template language, extending HTML with custom elements and attributes
to accommodate the needs of your application.

In this one-hour code lab, you'll create an AngularDart web app
that generates a pirate badge.
(If you've already completed the [first Dart code lab](https://www.dartlang.org/codelabs/darrrt/),
this app should be familiar, but the code is completely different.)

**Important:**
AngularDart is in beta, and its API is subject to change.
Before AngularDart's 1.0 release,
we expect to fix
[these bugs](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/issues?milestone=12)
(and more).
